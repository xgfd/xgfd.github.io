When preparing for a undergraduate programming class I decided to make a simple Javascript sandbox that allows students to code collaboratively. There were loads of libraries for collaborative editing but I decided to do my own exploration on algorithms that those libraries implement.

A quick search showed two algorithms that are at the core of collaborative editing, difference algorithms (diff) and operational transformation (ot).

A diff algorithm determines the differences between two sequences of symbols (e.g. strings). The basic diff algorithm is described in *[An O(ND) Difference Algorithm and its Variations](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjb1InygdzKAhWMND4KHZvlBiMQFgglMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.xmailserver.org%2Fdiff2.pdf&usg=AFQjCNEi2B2VB8W9Fdnd4QxgxmSw5uW0Yg&sig2=Fw9glCpzwxSQF5WtiQhPRw)* by Eugene Myers. This post tries to (re)explain this elegant algorithm.

To understand the diff algorithm we need to firstly introduce the concept of edit graph:

> For two sequences S = s<sub>1</sub> s<sub>2</sub> . . . s<sub>N</sub> and L = l<sub>1</sub> l<sub>2</sub> . . . l<sub>M</sub> , the edit graph for S and L has a vertex at each point in the grid (x, y), x ∈ [0, N] and y ∈ [0, M]. The vertices of the edit graph are connected by horizontal, vertical, and diagonal directed edges to form a directed acyclic graph. Horizontal edges connect each vertex to its right neighbor, i.e. (x−1, y) → (x, y) for x ∈ [1, N] and y ∈ [0, M]. Vertical edges connect each vertex to the neighbor below it, i.e. (x, y−1) → (x, y) for x ∈ [0, N] and y ∈ [1, M]. If s<sub>x</sub> = l<sub>y</sub> then there is a diagonal edge connecting vertex (x−1, y−1) to vertex (x, y).

As an example, the edit graph of two sequences *S = ABCABBA* and *L = CBABAC* is shown below. Thinking of going right as deleting a symbol from *S*, going down as inserting a symbol, following a diagonal edge as keeping the symbol (or skipping it), then any path from the left upper corner *(0, 0)* to the right bottom corner *(7, 6)* gives a sequence of modifications (deletion or insertion) that transform *S* to *L*.

![Edit graph](/public/fig/edit_graph.png)

For example, a path go straight right then down, i.e. *(0, 0) → (7, 0) → (7, 6)*, corresponds to the edit sequence *[-A, -B, -C, -A, -B, -B, -A, +C, +B, +A, +B, +A, +C]*, and the bolded path in the edit graph corresponds to the edit sequence *[-A, -B, C, +B, A, B, -B, A, +C]*, where *-X* denotes deleting the character *X*, *X* denotes skipping it, and *+X* denotes insertion (imagine the cursor starts at the left of *S*, deletion is to press the Del key, skipping is to press the → key, and insertion is to press the key of the inserted character).

The problem to identify the difference between *S* and *L* equals to finding the edit sequence with the minimum number of deletions and insertions together (skipping doesn't count). This minimum edit sequence is called the Shortest Edit Script (SES) that converts sequence *S* into sequence *L*. In the above examples, the first edit sequence has 7 deletions and 6 insertions, while the second has 3 deletions and 2 insertions. It turns out that the second edit sequence has the minimum total number of deletions and insertions (5) and thus it's a SES (there can be more than one SES) of *S* and *L*.

Since the total number of edits cannot not exceed the sum of the length of the two sequences, minimising the number of edits is the same as skipping as many symbols as possible. 

> Let D be the number of insertions and deletions of a path, L be the number of diagonal edges of the path, and N and M be the length of the two sequences of symbols respectively, we have D = N + M - 2L.

Actually finding a SES is the same as finding the longest subsequence of symbols from *S* and *L* that are 1) common between the two sequences, and 2) in the same order in each sequence. This subsequence is called the longest common subsequence (LCS) of *S* and *L*. It is distinct from the Longest Common Substring, which has to be contiguous. Again, multiple LCSs may exist for two sequences. In the case of *S* and *L*, a LCS is *CABA*.

> The definition of LCS implies that in the edit graph LCS consists of only diagonal edges (shared symbols) that belong to the same path (keeping the order).

> Give diagonal edges weight 0 and non-diagonal edges weight 1. The LCS/SES problem is equivalent to finding a minimum-cost path from (0, 0) to (N, M) in the weighted edit graph and is thus a special instance of the single-source shortest path problem. However a general shortest path algorithm isn't efficient in this specific case. There's no need to traverse all vertices of the edit graph, as shown by the algorithm below. 

Now some definitions to help understand the diff algorithm.

> + **diagonal k** In the edit graph all points *(x, y)* for which *x - y = k* lie on a diagonal line, and we call it diagonal k, where *k ∈ [-M, N]* (left-bottom is on diagonal -M and right-up is on diagonal N). 

> + **D-path** A D-path is path starting at *(0, 0)* that has exactly D non-diagonal edges. A D-path must consists of a prefix (D-1)-path followed by a horizontal or vertical edge and 0 or more continuous diagonal edges. 

Intuitively the algorithm starts with point *(0, 0)*, which is on 0-path, and iteratively finds the furthest endpoints of 1-path, 2-path (named envelop of D-path endpoints) etc., until point *(N, M)* is reached, as shown in the figure.

![Edit graph](/public/fig/furthest_reaching.png)

This procedure looks like the following Javascript code.

{% highlight javascript %}
function diff(S, L) {
    var N = S.length,
        M = L.length;

    for (var D = 0; D <= M + N; D++) {
        // find envelop of D-path endpoints
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Now let's figure out how to find furthest D-path endpoints. A D-path can only end on k diagonals for those *k ∈ {−D, −D +2, . . . D−2, D}*. Assuming furthest D-path endpoints are stored in an array *V*, for which *V[k]* gives the endpoint of the D-path on diagonal k, *V* would look like *V[-D]*, *V[-D+2]*, ..., *V[D-2]*. For an endpoint *(x, y)* we store only *x* in *V*, i.e. *V[k] = x*, and *y* can be computed as *x - k* (definition of diagonal k). 

The furthest endpoint of (D+1)-path on diagonal k can be reached by either moving right one step from the furthest D-path endpoint on diagonal k-1 (*V[k-1]*) and then following diagonal edges on diagonal k as far as possible, or moving down one step from diagonal k+1 (*V[k+1]*).

> The furthest D-path endpoints and (D+1)-path endpoints are on disjoint diagonals. Therefore they can co-exist in V in each iteration of finding furthest (D+1)-path endpoints. 

The code for the above procedure is shown below:

{% highlight javascript %}
function diff(S, L) {
    var N = S.length,
        M = L.length;

    var V = [];
    V[1] = 0; // virtual point (0, -1) for computing 0-path

    for (var D = 0; D <= M + N; D++) {
        // find envelop of D-path endpoints
        // A D-path must end on diagonal k ∈ { − D, − D + 2, . . . D − 2, D }.
        for (var k = -D; k <= D; k += 2) {
            var x, y;
            switch (k) {
                // lower boundry, only possible to move down from diagonal k-1
                case -D:
                    x = V[k + 1];
                    break;
                    // upper boudry, only possible to move right from diagonal k-1
                case D:
                    x = V[k - 1] + 1;
                    break;
                default:
                    if (V[k - 1] < V[k + 1]) { //  move down
                        x = V[k + 1];
                    } else { // move right
                        x = V[k - 1] + 1;
                    }
            }
        }

        y = x - k;

        // follw diagonal edges
        // edit graph index - 1 = string index
        while (x < N && y < M && S[x] === L[y]) {
            x++;
            y++;
        }

        V[k] = x;

        if (x >= N && y >= M) {
            // found SES of length D
            // need to restore the SES
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

The code above gives the length of a SES, but there's no way to construct the SES (since *V* only stores vertices of the most recent two iterations). In the paper it keeps a copy of *V* in each iteration. Let *V<sub>D</sub>* be the furthest endpoints of D-paths, for an end point *V<sub>D</sub>[k]*, it is straightforward to determine whether *V<sub>D-1</sub>[k+1]* leads to *V<sub>D</sub>[k]*, and thus includes a vertical edge or a horizontal edge followed by diagonal edges in the SES.

In this article I'm going to use a different approach. A vertex is presented as a data structure containing its coordinates and a link pointing back to the vertex that lead to this vertex. This structure enables us to restore the SES from its endpoint via backtracking. The modified diff algorithm is shown below.

{% highlight javascript %}

    var N = S.length,
        M = L.length;

    var V = [];
    // virtual point (0, -1) for computing 0-path
    V[1] = {
        x: 0,
        parent: null
    };

    for (var D = 0; D <= M + N; D++) {
        // find envelop of D-path endpoints
        // A D-path must end on diagonal k ∈ { − D, − D + 2, . . . D − 2, D }.
        for (var k = -D; k <= D; k += 2) {
            var x, y, parent;
            switch (k) {
                // lower boundry, only possible to move down from diagonal k+1
                case -D:
                    parent = V[k + 1];
                    x = parent.x;

                    // upper boudry, only possible to move right from diagonal k-1

`diff('ABCABBA', 'CBABAC')` gives *["-A", "-B", "C", "+B", "A", "B", "-B", "A", "+C"]*.
